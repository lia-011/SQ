                <h1>HISTORY OF <span>PEKAN KUNDASANG</span></h2>
                <p>Historically, Pekan Kundasang was home to indigenous Dusun and Kadazan communities who engaged in farming. During World War II, it became part of the tragic Sandakan Death Marches, where Allied POWs were forced to march through the area, leading to the deaths of many prisoners. Post-war, the region developed into an agricultural hub, particularly for vegetables, thanks to its favorable climate. Today, Kundasang is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway to Mount Kinabalu and housing memorials such as the Kundasang War Memorial Park to honor the POWs, while its agricultural and tourism sectors continue to shape its identity.</p>
